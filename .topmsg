Subject: [PATCH] systemd/php-fpm

php-fpm support, 

requires:
  - requires hash patch (nix)
    github.com/MarcWeber/nix/tree/experimental/hash
    (also found in github.com/MarcWeber/nixpkgs branch experimental/nix)

  - requires patches to PHP
    github.com/MarcWeber/nix/tree/experimental/php
    can't feed upstream because it depends on
    branch experimental/multiple-versions-in-one-file

  - maybe a security review should be done.
    Works for me.

TODO: add usage sample
