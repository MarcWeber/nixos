Subject: [PATCH] systemd/multi-shell-support

bash setup changes:

- new option environment.bashFeatures modularizing bash setup
  implementations based on previous code: prompt, completion, aliases, other

- provide /etc/bash/setup-all shell scripts setting those features up
  You can opt out by defining keys in DID_NIX_BASH_FEATURES, use declare -A
  first (see comment)

- provide /etc/skel/.bashrc which by default sources source-all
  This way users can opt-out. Mind that I wrote a shadow patch so that user-add
  creates ~/.bashrc as file, not as symlink

- support XML_CATALOG_FILES, so that you can use xmllint like tools without
  having them download dts easily

- introduce nix-bash-lib which provides some helper functions.
  It is sourced as needed.

zsh:
  implement the very same.
  Please note that the zshrc hack found in nixpkgs is obsolete now.

TODO: provide other implementations (fish etc)
