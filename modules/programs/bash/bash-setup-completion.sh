# can be sourced by user to setup (unoptrusive) completion for bash

# 1) never source a completion script twice so that later profiles don't change
#    behaviour of earlier (more important ones)
# 2) allow users to opt-out from individual annoying completion scripts by
#    defining key
declare -A NIX_COMPL_SCRIPT_SOURCED

# potential problems (-rev 20179)
#  - It doesn't support filenames with spaces.
#  - It inserts a space after the filename when tab-completing in an
#    "svn" command.
#  - Many people find it annoying that tab-completion on commands like
#    "tar" only matches filenames with the "right" extension.
#  - Llu√≠s reported bash apparently crashing on some tab completions.
# comment: Does this apply to complete.gnu-longopt or also to bash_completion?
